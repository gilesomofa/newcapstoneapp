This project was created for teachers (primarily those who work with students that require constant behavior monitoring.) This app provides a tool which allows the teacher to add students using the 'add new student'form and 'add new behavior' to create additional behaviors to monitor.

As of this initial release (Spring 2020), the app does not have many features that the developer wishes to implement in the future. In upcoming iterations, users will be able to create reports such as:
-frequency of preferred or non preferred behaviors per student, per classroom, per teacher, per date time.

The data schemas have been modeled to permit the scale of this app to achieve the above goals.

Hopefully, the developer will be able to create other features that could make this app a viable product for enterprise. Particularly a section of the app that integrates academic and Social Emotional Learning resources. The ultimate goal of the developer is to create a multi-user interface where educators, school administration, parents, and students can use the app to share data, and resources as well as communicate.
